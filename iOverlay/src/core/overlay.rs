//! This module contains functionality to construct and manage overlays, which are used to perform

//! manage subject and clip polygons and convert them into graphs for further operations.

    /// The output is a `IntShapes`, where:

    /// Note: Outer boundary paths have a counterclockwise order, and holes have a clockwise order.
    /// ### Usage:
    /// This function is suitable when a single, optimized Boolean operation is required on the provided
    /// geometry. For example:
    ///
    /// ```rust
    /// use i_float::int::point::IntPoint;
    /// use i_float::int_pnt;
    /// use i_overlay::core::fill_rule::FillRule;
    /// use i_overlay::core::overlay::Overlay;
    /// use i_overlay::core::overlay_rule::OverlayRule;
    ///
    /// let left_rect = [int_pnt!(0, 0), int_pnt!(0, 10), int_pnt!(10, 10), int_pnt!(10, 0)];

    /// let result = overlay.overlay(OverlayRule::Union, FillRule::EvenOdd);
